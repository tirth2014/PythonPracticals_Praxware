
Python Anonymous/Lambda Function

anonymous function, also known as lambda functions.

anonymous function is a function that is defined without a name.

While normal functions are defined using the def keyword in Python, anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword.

anonymous functions are also called lambda functions.

Syntax of Lambda Function in python

lambda arguments: expression

Lambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned. Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required.

double = lambda x: x * 2
print(double(5))


# Program to filter out only the even items from a list

my_list = [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 11, 3, 12]
l
new_list = list(filter(lambda x: (x%2 == 0) , my_list))

print(new_list)


# Program to double each item in a list using map()

my_list = [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 11, 3, 12]

new_list = list(map(lambda x: x * 2 , my_list))

print(new_list)
